##Brief description
	The project is written in 30 hours and submitted to hackFSU(a hackathron held in florida state university during Feb5-7 2016)
### Inspiration
- The project is inspired when talking to the statefarm engineer


### What it does
- Typically, this chrome plugin is used for help saving the time of agent of insurance company on the comment of consumer.
- And the plugin is currently used for analyze the comment on http://www.customerservicescoreboard.com
### How I built it
- I spend 30 hours working on my own and use different kind of javascript library to visualize the data I processed(using python to find pattern)

### Challenges I ran into
- This is the first time I write a chrome plugin. And I know nothing about it before the hackathron begin.
- The most difficult part is that debugging javascript and html is much harder than c++ or python. So I stuck in many places for a long time until I find some kind mentors that can help me.

### Accomplishments that I'm proud of
- I finally finish the project and I overcome all the problem with the help of the mentors and google myself.

### What I learned
- I learn how to write chrome plugin.
- I learn how to use d3.js and jqcloud.



### What's next for comment_visualizer
- I will be working on the comment parsing and make the plugin more accurate and powerful
